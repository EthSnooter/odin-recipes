    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>2 (3.5 ounce) links Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 and a half cups of water</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>2 metal skewers</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of BBQ sauce, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <div>
        <ol>
            <li>Place sausages into a skillet over medium heat and pour in water. Add a large pinch of salt to the water and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for about 3 minutes per side.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Remove sausages from pan and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour. Insert a metal skewer the long way through each cooled sausage.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Pour BBQ sauce into a small bowl.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place a sausage on a work surface and start making a knife cut about 3/4 inch from the end, holding the knife blade at a slight angle and cutting down to the skewer. Slowly rotate the sausage and continue cutting in a spiral until sausage is cut to about 1 inch from the other end. Gently spread the sausage apart on the skewer to create about 1/2 inch of space between the curls.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Place sausages onto the preheated grill and cook until browned and meat is no longer pink inside, about 6 minutes; turn occasionally.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Brush sausages with BBQ sauce using a pastry brush when sausages are nearly done. Cook, continuing to turn sausages, until sauce has caramelized onto the meat, about 1 minute per side. Transfer to a plate and let sausages cool for about 30 seconds before removing skewers for serving.</li>
        </ol>
